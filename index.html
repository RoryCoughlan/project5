    <h2>3. Another Night on the Floor, Live from Somewhere - Inhaler</h2>
    <p>Live from Somewhere, Another Night on the Floor was a hit off Inhalers most successful album. The band, originally from Dublin, found success in their first album and are still quite new on the scene..</p>

    <h2>2. Private Presley, Live from AudioTree - Peach Pit</h2>
    <p>Live from AudioTree, Peach Pit differed from their usual Canadian rock to make this masterpiece. This song is probably in my top 10 of all time, and the drums and guitar (espcially toward the end) are just increadible.</p>

    <h2>1. House of the Rising Sun, Live from New Orleans - Mumford and Sons, ft. Celisse and Trombone Shorty</h2>
    <p>This cover of the Animals "House of the Rising Sun" has truely been on repeat. Live <strong>from</strong> New Orleans, the added trombone and electric guitar make it one of those I can't turn off.</p>
